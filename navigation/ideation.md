<div>
<ul style="border: 4px solid green; font-size: 1em; padding: 10px;">
  <li><strong>rpg.md:</strong> The JavaScript object literal pattern helps organize and manage the important parts of a program in one place. It makes things easier to understand and control, like putting all your tools in one toolbox, so you know where everything is when you need it.</li>
  <li><strong>GameControl.js:</strong> Defines data for assets in the game and starts the game.</li>
  <li><strong>GameEnv.js:</strong> Uses a classic Java static class pattern that manages the game environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Background.js:</strong> Creates the background.</li>
  <li><strong>Player.js:</strong> Creates the player.</li>
</ul>

  <p style="border: 4px solid red; font-size: 1.5em; padding: 10px;">What I want to do with my RPG </p>
</div>

<ul style="border: 4px solid green; font-size: 1em; padding: 10px;">
  <li><strong>Add an NPC:</strong> On the base level, I plan to add an NPC that you are able to interact with. Further down the road I plan to make it so you are able to purchase items that can help you in the game.  </li>
<li><strong>Add music and sound effects:</strong> I added calming background music that you are able to play using shift while on the RPG game tab. I plan to add sound effects to my game in the fututre!  </li>
<li><strong>Add battles with NPCs:</strong> I would like to add opponents you can battle in the game and use the weapons/abilities that you can buy from the NPC.  </li>
<li><strong>Create new scenes</strong> Creating new scenes that the character you play as can walk through would be a great touch to my RPG game.   </li>
</ul>
