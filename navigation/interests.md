## VALORANT

### What is VALORANT?
<p style="color: red;">Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter that features two teams of five players each. One team takes on the role of attackers, whose objective is to plant a spike (essentially a bomb) at designated sites on the map. The other team, the defenders, must prevent the spike from being planted or defuse it once it has been set. Each round begins with players purchasing different weapons and unique abilities for their chosen agents. Victory in the game comes from being the first team to win 13 rounds, with teams switching roles between attackers and defenders after 12 rounds.</p>

### My love-hate relationship with the game
**(Slight rant)**
### Hate
<p style="color: red;">Every time I load up this game I am filled with excitement due to the fact that my friends and I are about to win all of our games and rank up. Unfortunately, this is never the case. I will load up into a game with two of my friends as my teammates and we are given two randoms to fill the five total spots. The game starts and we win a couple of rounds. I get a couple of kills here and there and perform pretty well. Until the second half of the game hits. The score is 9-3, we are up. The first round of the second half begins and we all start getting destroyed by one person. "It is just one round," I think to myself but deep down I know the game is about to go into shambles. Round after round I'm whiffing my shots and all of my teammates are angry. Suddenly we are down and I have completely lost control of my mental game. The other team trash-talks us and laughs at us in the chat. We lose the game. But for some reason, I still decide to go into another one after such a horrid experience. But this time we barely even took 2 rounds and lost 13-2. All of my friends get off and I follow. Shortly after, I think to myself "Was this really a good way to spend my Sunday night." Well, the answer is no, it wasn't.</p>

### Love
<p style="color: red;">On the other hand, VALORANT can be so fun when you have a full team with just your friends and you guys aren't too focused on winning but more on just having fun and enjoying your time. </p>

### Some things I wonder about in VALORANT
```
- Valorant, how many coders/developers does it take to make a FPS game such as Valorant?
- How long would it take to create a new character with totally new abilities?
- When new maps are created, I wonder how long it takes to fix the bugs that are found with the map.
