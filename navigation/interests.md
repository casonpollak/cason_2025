## Coding topics I am interested in 

### FPS games
```
- Valorant, how many coders/developers take to make a FPS game such as Valorant?
- How long would it take to create a new character with totally new abilities?
- When new maps are created, I wonder how long it takes to fix the bugs that are found with the map.
```

### Battle Royale games
```
- 
```
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo | default: site.baseurl | remove: "/" }}"
        issue-term="title"
        theme="github-light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
