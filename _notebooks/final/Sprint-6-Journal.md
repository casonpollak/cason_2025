# Sprint 6 Blogs

#### What will I use this blog for?
I will be using this blog to track my progress throughought the weeks of Sprint 6. Every week I will talk about the problems I ran into, what I completed and what I am looking forward to completing in the following week. I will be including multiple types of media, screenshots, videos, etc to allow for a further understanding of what I completed or an example of the idea that I had thought of. 

## Week 18 entry
During Week 18, my main goal was to complete and teach my groups notebook which is a lesson on enemies and collision. The first thing I did was create a plan of what I wanted included the lesson. The second thing that I did was I begun creating the three skeletal files required for my lesson. I made the files for the following: a notebook for a lesson on collisions with enemies within the platformer game, a notebook for ideas and hacks on how someone can incorperate new ideas utilizing the taught collision, and finally I made a notebook explaining colision with blocks within the game. Over the week I worked on these notebooks and eventually finished them. I added snippets of examples with simple explanations so my classmates would be able to understand the topics easier. Once I finished all of the notebooks I read over them and prepared to present. My group and I presented the notebooks and it went very well. Here are some screenshots from the notebooks: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6c4790-b555-46d2-9072-5b03ec70d926)

Other things that I did during week 18 consisted of creating the help-system folder in the notebooks folder to organize the new help system notebooks being created, adding helpful comments in the area where you link your notebooks, and helping my team work on the different ending by giving suggestions on what we should change, keep, and add. 

## Week 19
During Week 19 I was absent throughout the whole week because I had the flu so this definitely hindered my communication with the team and my avaliability but I still perservered and was able to get some work done. The first thing that I worked on this week was creating my burndown checklist. This checklist consisted of my goals and my tasks in order to keep me on track and productive. The greatest accomplish my team made was thinking of a great idea to add to our level. This idea consists of pieces of trash being scattered around the level and the player must pick them up and interact with a garbage bin in order to gain a powerup. This is a great idea becuase it promotes positive enviromental behavior and also is a challenging and fun task for the player to complete. My teamates told me about this idea over slack and I loved it. We plan on adding some of the base code and getting all the sprites figured out during the next couple of weeks.
